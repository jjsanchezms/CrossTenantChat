# Azure Communication Services UI Library CDN Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

The error "Failed to load script: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@azure/communication-react@1.29.0/dist/acs-ui.min.js - error" occurs because the Azure Communication Services UI Library does not provide a UMD (Universal Module Definition) build that can be loaded directly via CDN script tags.

## Root Cause

The `@azure/communication-react` package is designed primarily for modern React applications that use module bundlers (webpack, Vite, etc.). The package only provides:
- **CommonJS build** (`dist-cjs/`) - For Node.js environments
- **ES Modules build** (`dist-esm/`) - For modern bundlers
- **No UMD build** - Cannot be loaded via `<script>` tags

## ‚úÖ Resolution Applied

### 1. Removed Non-Existent Script Tags
```html
<!-- REMOVED: This script does not exist -->
<!-- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@azure/communication-react@1.29.0/dist/acs-ui.min.js"></script> -->
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated JavaScript to provide clear error messages when the library is not available:

```javascript
// Enhanced error detection with helpful explanations
if (!commReact) {
  const error = `‚ùå Azure Communication Services UI Library Issue:
  
  The Azure Communication React library does not provide a UMD build 
  that can be loaded via CDN script tags. This is a known limitation.
  
  SOLUTIONS:
  1. Use a bundler like webpack, Vite, or Create React App
  2. Use the Azure Communication Services calling SDK directly
  3. Consider alternative UI libraries that provide UMD builds`;
  
  throw new Error('Azure Communication Services UI Library is not available for CDN usage');
}
```

### 3. Added User-Friendly Warnings
Both calling pages now show informative alerts about this limitation.

## üîß Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Azure Communication Services Calling SDK Directly
Instead of the UI Library, use the core calling SDK which does have CDN support:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@azure/communication-calling@1.24.1/dist/azure-communication-calling.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@azure/communication-common@2.5.1/dist/communication-common.min.js"></script>
```

### Option 2: Build a Custom Solution
Create your own UI components using the core ACS calling SDK:

```javascript
// Use the calling SDK directly for a custom UI
const callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential);
const call = callAgent.startCall([{ communicationUserId: 'user-id' }]);
```

### Option 3: Use a Module Bundler (Recommended for Production)
For production applications, set up a proper React project:

```bash
# Create React App
npx create-react-app my-acs-app
cd my-acs-app
npm install @azure/communication-react @azure/communication-calling @azure/communication-common

# Or with Vite
npm create vite@latest my-acs-app -- --template react
cd my-acs-app
npm install @azure/communication-react @azure/communication-calling @azure/communication-common
```

### Option 4: Alternative UI Libraries
Consider UI libraries that do provide UMD builds:
- **Agora Web SDK** - Has UMD builds available
- **Jitsi Meet API** - Can be loaded via CDN
- **Daily.js** - Provides browser-ready builds

## üìã Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ
- React and ReactDOM load successfully from CDN
- Azure Communication Common library loads successfully
- Proper error handling and user messaging
- No more runtime exceptions from missing libraries

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
- Azure Communication React UI Library cannot be loaded via CDN
- Call Composite component is not available for direct browser usage
- Full calling functionality requires alternative implementation

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Development/Testing
- Use the error handling approach implemented
- Display clear messages to developers about limitations
- Consider mocking the calling functionality for UI development

### For Production
1. **Migrate to a bundled approach** using Create React App, Vite, or Next.js
2. **Use the core ACS calling SDK directly** and build custom UI components
3. **Consider alternative calling solutions** that provide better browser compatibility

## üîç Technical Details

### Package Structure Investigation
- **jsdelivr CDN**: `/dist/` folder does not contain UMD builds
- **unpkg CDN**: Shows `dist-cjs/` and `dist-esm/` but no UMD files
- **npm package.json**: No `browser` field or UMD entry point defined

### Error Signatures
- Original: `Failed to load script: ...acs-ui.min.js - error`
- Improved: Clear explanation of limitation with next steps

This resolution transforms a confusing 404 error into a clear explanation of the limitation and provides actionable next steps for developers.

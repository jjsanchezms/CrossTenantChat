# ACS Debug Panel Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Missing ACS Send Chat Debug Information
**Problem**: The ACS Debug info panel was not showing verbose information about chat message operations.
**Root Cause**: The operation history functionality was partially implemented but not fully integrated into the debug panel.
**Solution**: 
- Created enhanced `AcsDebugPanelEnhanced.razor` component with comprehensive operation tracking
- Added complete operation history display with real-time auto-refresh
- Integrated with existing `IAcsOperationTracker` service that was already capturing detailed ACS operations

### 2. Missing JSON-Formatted Token Information  
**Problem**: Token information was displayed in a basic format without detailed debugging information.
**Solution**:
- Added "Show Token Info" toggle button in the debug panel
- Implemented `GetTokenInfoJson()` method that displays token details in JSON format including:
  - Token availability and length
  - Token preview (first 20 characters)
  - Expiration time and status
  - Time until expiry
  - ACS User ID and tenant information
  - Cross-tenant status

### 3. Chat Window Resize Issue
**Problem**: When the ACS Debug info panel was expanded, it caused the chat window to resize incorrectly.
**Root Cause**: The debug panel was placed inside the chat card container, causing layout conflicts.
**Solution**:
- Modified `Chat.razor` layout structure to use flexbox (`d-flex flex-column`)
- Moved debug panel outside the chat card into a separate `flex-shrink-0` container
- Set `FooterStyle="false"` to prevent layout interference
- The chat area now maintains proper proportions when the debug panel expands

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Debug Panel Features:
- **Operation History Section**: Shows detailed ACS operation tracking
  - üì§ MessageSend operations with step-by-step breakdown
  - üîë TokenExchange operations
  - üí¨ ThreadCreation operations
  - Real-time auto-refresh every 2 seconds when expanded
  
- **Detailed Step Display**: Each operation shows:
  - ‚úÖ Success/failure indicators for each step
  - Timing information (duration in milliseconds)
  - Metadata about tokens, IDs, and parameters
  - Error messages for failed operations
  - Expandable step details

- **Token Information Display**: JSON-formatted token details including:
  ```json
  {
    "hasToken": true,
    "tokenLength": 1234,
    "tokenPreview": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJh...",
    "expiresOn": "2025-08-20T15:30:00Z",
    "isExpired": false,
    "timeUntilExpiry": "02:45:30",
    "acsUserId": "8:acs:12345...",
    "tenantName": "Contoso",
    "isFromFabrikam": false
  }
  ```

### Layout Improvements:
- Chat window now uses proper flex layout that prevents resizing issues
- Debug panel positioned as separate section below chat area
- Maintains responsive design and proper proportions

## How to Test

1. **Access the Enhanced Debug Panel**:
   - Navigate to `/chat` in the running application (http://localhost:5069)
   - Scroll down to see the "üß≠ ACS Debug Info" panel
   - Expand it to see all the enhanced information

2. **View ACS Operation Tracking**:
   - Create a chat thread or select an existing one
   - Send a message (or use the "üß™ Test ACS" button)
   - Expand the "üîç Operation History" section
   - You'll see detailed MessageSend operations with all ACS steps

3. **View Token Information**:
   - In the debug panel, find the "Token" section
   - Click "Show Token Info" to see JSON-formatted token details
   - Information auto-updates as tokens are refreshed

4. **Verify Layout Fix**:
   - With a chat thread selected, expand and collapse the debug panel
   - The chat window above should maintain proper size and proportions
   - No unwanted resizing or layout shifts should occur

## Files Modified

- **New**: `Components/Shared/AcsDebugPanelEnhanced.razor` - Complete enhanced debug panel
- **Modified**: `Components/Pages/Chat.razor` - Updated layout structure and component reference
- **Existing**: Operation tracking was already implemented in `LiveAzureCommunicationService.cs`

The enhanced debug panel now provides comprehensive visibility into all ACS operations with proper formatting and layout handling! üéâ

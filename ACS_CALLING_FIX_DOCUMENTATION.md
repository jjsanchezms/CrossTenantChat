# Azure Communication Services Calling UI Fix

## Problem Description

The Azure Communication Services (ACS) Calling UI was failing to start with the error:

```
Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException: Required libraries not loaded
Error: Required libraries not loaded
    at ensureGlobals (http://localhost:5000/js/acs-calling-ui.zrhzkj0bq2.js:34:11)
    at async Object.start (http://localhost:5000/js/acs-calling-ui.zrhzkj0bq2.js:45:7)
```

This error occurred when attempting to join a call using the Call Composite component from the Azure Communication Services UI Library.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Asynchronous Script Loading**: The `defer` attribute on script tags caused the required libraries (React, ReactDOM, Azure Communication React, and Azure Communication Common) to load asynchronously, making their availability timing unpredictable.

2. **Insufficient Loading Detection**: The original JavaScript code didn't have robust detection mechanisms to identify which specific libraries were missing or available.

3. **Short Timeout**: The original 8-second timeout was insufficient in some cases for all libraries to load completely.

4. **Global Variable Detection Issues**: The code wasn't checking all possible global variable names that the Azure Communication Services libraries might expose.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Synchronous Script Loading (Original Calling.razor)

Modified `/Components/Pages/Calling.razor` to:
- Remove `defer` attribute from all script tags to ensure synchronous loading
- Load scripts in the correct dependency order:
  1. React
  2. ReactDOM  
  3. Azure Communication Common
  4. Azure Communication React

### Fix 2: Enhanced Error Reporting and Debugging

Updated `/wwwroot/js/acs-calling-ui.js` to:
- Add comprehensive logging throughout the loading process
- Increase timeout from 8 seconds to 10 seconds
- Provide detailed error messages showing which libraries are missing
- Log available global variables for debugging
- Check multiple possible global variable names for Azure libraries

### Fix 3: Completely Improved Solution

Created new files:
- `/Components/Pages/CallingImproved.razor` - Enhanced calling page with better UX
- `/wwwroot/js/acs-calling-ui-improved.js` - Robust library loading with dynamic script injection

The improved solution features:
- **Dynamic Script Loading**: Programmatically loads scripts if they're not already present
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **User Feedback**: Visual status indicators and loading messages
- **Library Verification**: Built-in method to verify all libraries are properly loaded
- **Defensive Programming**: Multiple fallback mechanisms and extensive validation

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `Components/Pages/Calling.razor` - Fixed script loading order and added logging
2. `wwwroot/js/acs-calling-ui.js` - Enhanced error reporting and debugging
3. `Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor` - Added link to improved calling page

### New Files:
1. `Components/Pages/CallingImproved.razor` - Enhanced calling component
2. `wwwroot/js/acs-calling-ui-improved.js` - Robust library loading solution
3. `ACS_CALLING_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Usage Instructions

### Original Fixed Version
Navigate to `/calling` to use the original calling page with the synchronous loading fix.

### Improved Version  
Navigate to `/calling-improved` to use the enhanced version with:
- Automatic library loading verification
- Better error messages and user feedback
- More robust error handling
- Visual loading indicators

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the application
2. Navigate to either calling page
3. For the improved version, click "Check Libraries" to verify all dependencies are loaded
4. Enter a Group ID and Display Name
5. Click "Join demo call" to test the fix

## Technical Details

### Library Dependencies
The ACS Call Composite requires these libraries in order:
1. **React** (v18.2.0) - UI framework
2. **ReactDOM** (v18.2.0) - React DOM manipulation
3. **Azure Communication Common** (v2.5.1) - ACS common utilities and credentials
4. **Azure Communication React** (v1.29.0) - ACS UI components

### Global Variables
The libraries expose these potential global variables:
- React: `window.React`
- ReactDOM: `window.ReactDOM`
- Azure Communication Common: `window.AzureCommunication`, `window.AzureCommunicationCommon`
- Azure Communication React: `window.AzureCommunicationReact`, `window.communicationReact`

### Error Prevention Strategies
1. **Synchronous Loading**: Ensures dependencies are available before dependent code runs
2. **Extended Timeout**: Allows sufficient time for CDN resources to load
3. **Multiple Detection Methods**: Checks various possible global variable names
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Programmatically loads missing dependencies
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Provides detailed debugging information

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify network connectivity to CDN resources
3. Try the "Check Libraries" button in the improved version
4. Review the detailed logging output for specific failure points
5. Ensure the application is running with proper authentication (Live environment may require Azure AD setup)

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements:
1. **Local Library Hosting**: Host the required libraries locally to avoid CDN dependencies
2. **Webpack/Bundling**: Use a proper module bundler to manage dependencies
3. **TypeScript**: Add type safety for better development experience
4. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for the JavaScript library loading logic
